Notes and tidbits from Hubbard's "How To Measure Anything"

### Applied Information Economics: A Universal Approach to Measurement

1. Define the decision
2. Determine what you know now
3. Compute the value of additional information (if none, go to step five)
4. Measure where information value is high (return to steps two and three until further measurement isn't needed)
5. Make a decision and act on it.

### Rule of Five

Page 44

There is a 93.75% change that the median of a population is between the smallest and largest values in any random sample of five from that population.

### Single Sample Majority Rule

Page 46

Given maximum uncertainty about a population proportion (you believe your outcome could be 0-100% with all values being equally likely) there is a 75% chance that a single randomly selected sample is from the majority of the population.
